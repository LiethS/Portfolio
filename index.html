                <div class="metitles">Who am I?</div>
                <div class="whoareyou">My name is Lieth Shehadeh, I am currently a 4th year student in the Computer Science
                    Honours program at York University. I am from Jordan, and I love to learn about astronomy and
                    different philosophical views on my own time. I enjoy playing video games and Soccer with my
                    friends when I find the time. My unique strengths include, but are not limited to, my adaptability
                    and my responsibility. I grew up in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates until I was 10 years old, then I
                    lived the rest of my life here in Mississauga, Ontario. I’ve lived most of my life in environments
                    I would call quite fortunate, I believe what truly shaped me into who I am is my parents and
                    friends. My parents taught me what is right and wrong as well as how to be independent. I
                    believe I have made very good decisions in my life when choosing friends, which has led me to
                    making very kind and dependable friends. I chose York University as I was searching for a co-op
                    and found that many people suggested York’s co-op program. I have never really found anyone
                    to be inspiring other than my father. My dad has always amazed me, especially in how
                    independent he is. I learned how to be independent from him.
                </div>
                <div class="metitles">Recent Placement Reflection: Mondelēz International </div>
                <div class="reflection">Currently I work at Mondelez International as a Maintenance Co-op. My supervisor
                    Santiago Munera, the Maintenance Co-Leader, and I chose that my learning goal for this
                    placement was to get familiarized with the Mondelez food manufacturing process and develop
                    new methods to any approach to optimize the process. Although this is a difficult objective to
                    quantify, we’ve decided that the best way to measure my growth would be to determine how
                    many hours of work I can automate and how much money I can save the company through
                    optimization of processes. To determine if I was successful, we can test any scripts I create to see
                    the time saved as opposed to doing the tasks manually, we can also do some simple calculations
                    to determine how much more money my new method generates as opposed to the previous
                    approach.
                    
                    So far into the placement, I have learned many things. I first started by helping coworkers
                    in the office and getting to know them. I’ve realized that all my coworkers are quite nice and
                    helpful, so I am now comfortable with asking for help or anything if I ever need it. I helped
                    around with some printing jobs as well as some commissioning for some products. Simple but
                    irrelevant stuff so far, but I am having fun.
                    
                    I began using SAP which is a relational database and I’ve become quite proficient in it. I
                    have started working on a project, which involves me reorganizing and standardizing the SAP
                    equipment tree. This helps make everyone’s work much easier as the database becomes much
                    more organized in relation to the reality of the equipment’s states. I have become proficient
                    enough to be able to write scripts automating tedious tasks for PM Managers, saving them many
                    hours daily and many more yearly. I’ve created scripts to automate daily revisions done for every
                    weekday and every day of the weekend. I also created a script to automate the printing and
                    assigning of work orders which was a process taking up to an hour or two from 2-3 members of
                    the maintenance team.

                <div class="explanation">Although some might find this image boring, I find it scary, beautiful, inspiring, and extremely
                    interesting. Before choosing to go pursue computer science I initially wanted to become an
                    astronomer. Astronomy has always interested me, and I believe it has helped me realize that this
                    world is beautiful even in the simplest things. I may not be in the field of astronomy; however,
                    my goal is to become a programmer for some space agency. Even though I may not directly
                    interact with outer space, I would love to be someone who has contributed to the exploration of
                    it. This world is so vast and has so much of it yet to be explored or understood, I can call it
                    anything but boring, I am in love with it. I find the idea that there is so much to be understood
                    and the fact that there is so much yet to be seen unbelievably interesting. It has introduced me to
                    the side of me that loves to learn and understand all kinds of concepts, complicated or simple.</div>
